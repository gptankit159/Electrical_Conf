            Hon'ble Shri Dattaji Meghe is the architect of Nagar Yuwak Shikshan Santha, Nagpur. He has been the guiding star in spreading the light of education. His can-do-more attitude brought about an intellectual revolution that has transformed the social, educational, economic and cultural life of rural Maharashtra. <br>
            One lamp that lit strongly and firmly with a great vision of spreading the light of wisdom is our Hon'ble Shri Dattaji Meghe, the Chairman of Nagar Yuwak Shikshan Sanstha & Founder Chancellor of Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences is in active public life for more than 45 years. He represented the people of Maharashtra in Lok Sabha for 3 consecutive terms & was the Member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha). <br>
            He strongly believed that quality Education & Health can only bring the true transformation of the huge human resources of our nation. <br>
            In pursuit of our Chairman's social commitment, a modest beginning was made by starting a small educational institute almost 40 years ago, which has grown up into an educational empire covering almost all faculties of education spread all over Maharashtra state.

            I welcome one and all to Yeshwantrao Chavan College of Engineering, Nagpur, an autonomous institution affiliated to RTM Nagpur University. YCCE is committed in providing quality/relevant education and to enhance its practices by applying Best National and International practices.

            The Technological revolution and the forces of globalization are changing the very functioning of the organizations significantly in recent years. We at YCCE are alive to these changes and taking all the steps to mould our students accordingly.

            We strive for best results continuously, to enable our students to move forward and confidently to embrace change rather than follow; to innovate rather than stagnate and to initiate rather merely respond thereby to become efficient technocrats and dynamic entrepreneurs.

            We are committed to have an environment which provides expanded employment opportunities to our students and enriched knowledgebase to our faculty. We are happy to observe that employers' interest in YCCE is very high as evidenced by the excellent placement opportunities offered to our students in a number of industries & organizations.
