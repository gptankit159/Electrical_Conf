            I welcome one and all to <b>An International Conference On RECENT ADVANCES IN MATERIALS, MANUFACTURING AND MACHINE LEARNING</b> at Yeshwantrao Chavan College of Engineering, Nagpur, an autonomous institution affiliated to RTM Nagpur University. YCCE is committed in providing quality/relevant education and to enhance its practices by applying Best National and International practices.

            The Technological revolution and the forces of globalization are changing the very functioning of the organizations significantly in recent years. We at YCCE are alive to these changes and taking all the steps to mould our products accordingly.

            We strive for search results continuously to enable our students to move forward and confidently to embrace change rather than follow; to innovate rather than stagnate and to initiate rather merely respond thereby to become efficient technocrats and dynamic entrepreneurs.

            We are committed to have an environment which provides expanded employment opportunities to our students and enriched knowledge base to our faculty. We are happy to observe that employers' interest in YCCE is very high as evidenced by the excellent placement opportunities offered to our students in a number of industries & organizations.
